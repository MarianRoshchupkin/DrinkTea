# DrinkTea
Welcome to the DrinkTea Chat Bot, developed by a talented team of students from FESTU University for a Hackathon competition. Our goal was to create an AI-powered chatbot that can engage in meaningful conversations with users.

## Setup

To set up and run the DrinkTea AI Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Download Model Weights:**
   Download the model weights from the provided Google Drive link: [Model Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vbmg_wk6qsaJGX80IPt8FukAi4el22rb?usp=drive_link).

2. **Installation:**
   Once the model weights are downloaded, navigate to the location of your project files and create the following folder structure if it doesn't exist:


3. **Place Model Weights:**
- The `DrinkTea` directory is the root directory of your project.
- Inside the `DrinkTea` directory, you should have a subdirectory called `mfc`.
- Inside the `mfc` directory, place the downloaded model weights in the `ai_rubert_model` subdirectory.

4. **Running  with Docker**
